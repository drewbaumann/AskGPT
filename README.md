# AskGPT: ChatGPT Highlight Plugin for KOReader

Introducing AskGPT, a new plugin for KOReader that allows you to ask questions about the parts of the book you're reading and receive insightful answers from ChatGPT, an AI language model. With AskGPT, you can have a more interactive and engaging reading experience, and gain a deeper understanding of the content.

## Getting Started

To use this plugin, You'll need to do a few things:

Get [KoReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) installed on your e-reader. You can find instructions for doing this for a variety of devices [here](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=276).

If you want to do this on a Kindle, you are going to have to jailbreak it. I recommend following [this guide](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=320564) to jailbreak your Kindle.

An API key from OpenAI. Once you have your API key, create a `api_key.lua` file in the following structure:

```lua
local API_KEY = {
  key = "your_api_key",
}

return API_KEY
```

If you clone this project, you should be able to put the directory, `askgpt.koplugin`, in the `koreader/plugins` directory and it should work. If you want to use the plugin without cloning the project, you can download the zip file from the releases page and extract the `askgpt.koplugin` directory to the `koreader/plugins` directory.

## How To Use

To use AskGPT, simply highlight the text that you want to ask a question about, and select "Ask ChatGPT" from the menu. The plugin will then send your highlighted text to the ChatGPT API, and display the answer to your question in a pop-up window.

I hope you enjoy using this plugin and that it enhances your e-reading experience. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let me know!
